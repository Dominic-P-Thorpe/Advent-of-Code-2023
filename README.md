My advent of code for 2023 implemented in the Haskell Language (I used the Glasgow Haskel Compiler, aka GHC), chosen so I can get to grips more with this language and functional programming as a whole. 

Solutions are organised into 1 folder per day, and each part is kept in a separate file. Run each solution as follows, running the commands from the directory containing the solution, for example */AoC_1/*:

`ghci`

`:l part1.hs`

`partOne "input.txt"`

Substitute `part1.hs` for `part2.hs` and `partOne` for `partTwo` as appropriate.
